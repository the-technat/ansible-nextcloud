Ansible Playbook to setup nextcloud on Debian Bullseye.

## Credits

This is my very first ansible playbook and its mostly copied from [https://github.com/ReinerNippes/nextcloud](https://github.com/ReinerNippes/nextcloud).  

## Philosophy about variables

Ansible has [a lot of places](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html) where you can set variables. For this playbook the following pattern exists:

- Most variables are defined within a role's `default/main.yml` file and are considered to be overriden by users.
- Variables set in role's `vars/main.yml` are considered constant and should not be overriden by users.
- We don't set variables in the `inventory` file as this is mostly generated dynamically

## Usage

### Create inventory

Edit the inventory and adjust the Username, SSH Port and Public Key accordingly.

You can define some settings for your nextcloud in `settings.yml`.

Note: For the `nc_passwd` and `nc_db_password` variable it's highly recommended to store them in an ansible-vault file instead of the settings.yml. Here's how you do that:

```bash
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```

The command will prompt you for a Vault password and then open an editor where you can enter the secure variables. Once you save, the command will save that file in your directory but in an encrypted way.

Then run it like so:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
ansible-playbook nextcloud.yml -v  --ask-vault-pass -e "@secrets.ymlâ€œ
```
